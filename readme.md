> In the sample, both TemplateA and TemplateB will be created.

3. Edit Template A and B

- Contents of both Template A and Template B is free spaces and open to interpretation by you. By right-clicking on the bullet, a context menu will appear, allowing you to select the color and font size.

4. Perform check

- As usual, possible to either wait for the date to change or delete the current day's journal. To delete it, right-click on the date title and select "Delete" from the context menu.

5. Change to specific days of the week (Option)

   Open the page that was built. Click on the area to the right of WAITING labels to edit the renderer.
   1. Specify days of week in 3 letters like "Sun" and separate them with an "&". And possible to select 'All'. This is for bundling templates together.
   1. It is possible to replicate renderers, not limited to TemplateA and TemplateB. And manually change the names of TemplateA and TemplateB as they are just names of the templates.

## Questions

- Always turn on this plugin to execute rendering when the journal template is called. For Logseq mobile version, please manually call the template.
- We cannot create a template specifically for holidays at this time. There is a plan to allow for holiday templates to be set up by excluding holidays, but it will take some time to implement. I'm sure that by then, the name of this plugin will have changed to holidays, jokingly of course.‚ò∫Ô∏è
