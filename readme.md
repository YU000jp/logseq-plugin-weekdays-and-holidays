3. Edit Template A and B

- Contents of both Template A and Template B is free spaces and open to interpretation by you.

## Questions

- Always turn on this plugin to execute rendering when the journal template is called. For Logseq mobile version, please manually call the template.
- We cannot create a template specifically for holidays at this time. There is a plan to allow for holiday templates to be set up by excluding holidays, but it will take some time to implement.
