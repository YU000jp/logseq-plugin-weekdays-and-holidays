5. Change to specific days of the week (Option)

   Open the page that was built. Click on the area to the right of WAITING labels to edit the renderer.
   1. Specify days of week in 3 letters like "Sun" and separate them with an "&". And possible to select 'All'. This is for bundling templates together.
   1. It is possible to replicate renderers, not limited to Template-A and Template-B. And manually change the names of Template-A and Template-B as they are just names of the templates. A block can have a maximum of seven renderings, but if the weekdays overlap, only one of them will be executed. During runtime, the block with renderings be removed.

## Questions

- Always turn on this plugin for execute rendering when journal template is called. For Logseq mobile version, please manually call the template.
- At the moment, integration with existing plugins such as smart-blocks is not possible. We plan to address this in future updates.
- In the current version, standard Dynamic variables are not supported.
- For those who live every day like a holiday, this plugin may not be necessary.ü§£

## Plugin Changes Due to @logseq/libs Upgrade v0.0.15 (Unpublished)

- This plugin utilizes the @logseq/libs plugin API library. Currently, the older version of the SDK is unable to load templates as templates, so they are being loaded simply as block trees. However, there are plans to provide the functionality to load templates as templates in the future. This will enable integration with existing plugins such as smart-blocks. There is a possibility that changes in usage and the need for resetting configuration items may occur.
